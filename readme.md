## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Overview

There are two main Python scripts used for scraping:

### 1. `Mamikos Link Scrapper.py`

This script automates Mamikos search pages to collect URLs of individual kos listings.

#### Key Features:

- Navigates to a custom Mamikos search URL.
- Clicks the "Lihat lebih banyak lagi" button up to 15 times (configurable).
- Simulates Ctrl+Click to validate and collect unique product URLs.
- Saves all URLs into a CSV file.

### 2. `Mamikos Data Scrapper.py`

This script visits each kos URL (from the previous step) to extract detailed listing information.

#### Key Features:

- Reads URLs from the CSV.
- Aggressively scrolls each product page to load dynamic content.
- Uses Selenium for interactions & BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML.
- Extracts comprehensive data such as:
  - Price, room size, discounts, amenities, ratings, and transaction counts
  - Room availability, electricity inclusion, location, and more
- Saves final output in both JSON and CSV formats.

## üîí Anti-Detection Techniques

- Uses user-agent spoofing and disables WebDriver flags.
- Incorporates human-like delays to simulate user behavior.
- Breaks scraping into modular stages for better error handling and flexibility.
